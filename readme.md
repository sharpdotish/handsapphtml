**Test CSS Brief**

HandsApp is a simple application that allows users to create a list of words.

A freelance front-end developer was hired to work on the HTML and CSS template by Alpha Corp, unfortunately the developer is suddenly no longer able to complete the project. You have been hired by Alpha Corp to complete the task. Alpha Corpâ€™s backend developers will use this HTML template in their MVC framework. An Alpha Corp JS developer will finish all the javascript code so you can focus on CSS and HTML only. The original developer has made a few mistakes in the HTML, they have left some hints in the code where they need to complete tasks. They got the basic color scheme already set up. Clone their work and complete the design as fast as possible.
